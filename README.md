This course is teaching how to work with XV6 Operating System, based on Ubuntu.

## Installation Guide
follow: [Guide](https://gcallah.github.io/OperatingSystems/xv6Install.html) to install xv6

I used an ubuntu 16.04 VM to install, all commands ran on an xv6 emulator that was built using:
```bash
make clean
make qemu
```
